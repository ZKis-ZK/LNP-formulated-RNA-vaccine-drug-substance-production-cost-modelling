Modelling files related to the journal article titled “Resources, Production Scales and Time Required for Producing RNA Vaccines for the Global Pandemic Demand” Published in the MDPI Vaccines journal. Year of submission: 2020. Article Authors: Zoltán Kis, Cleo Kontoravdi, Robin Shattock, Nilay Shah.

This repository contains the following files:
•	the SuperPro Designer Version 11, Build 2 (Intelligen, Inc.) model of RNA vaccine drug substance production process using modified UTP (N1-methylpseudouridine-5'-triphosphate) at the 30 L bioreactor working volume scale: "RNA_vaccine_DS_production_modelling_mod-UTP_30L.spf”;
•	the economic evaluation report generated by SuperPro Designer for the model based on modified UTP (N1-methylpseudouridine-5'-triphosphate) at the 30 L bioreactor working volume scale: "RNA_vaccine_DS_production_modelling_mod-UTP_30L_EER.rtf;
•	the SuperPro Designer Version 11, Build 2 (Intelligen, Inc.) model of RNA vaccine drug substance production process using wild-type UTP (non-modified uridine-5'-triphosphate) at the 30 L bioreactor working volume scale: "RNA_vaccine_DS_production_modelling_wt-UTP_30L.spf”;
•	the economic evaluation report generated by SuperPro Designer for the model based on wild-type UTP (non-modified uridine-5'-triphosphate) at the 30 L bioreactor working volume scale: "RNA_vaccine_DS_production_modelling_wt-UTP_30L_EER.rtf";

The sensitivity analysis and scenario evaluations for both mRNA and saRNA vaccines were generated based on the above modelling files by changing modelling inputs such as scale of the production process, production titre, process failure rate, purchase price of 5’ cap analogue (CleanCap), purchase price of the modified UTP, labour costs and cost of quality control testing (QC/QA cost). The production amounts were generated in SuperPro Designer in grams and the number of doses and cost per dose were calculated in MS Excel. The modelling outputs of resource requirements (i.e. Capital Costs, Operating Costs, Number of facilities, Number of production batches), production volumes, production rates (in doses per year) were obtained either directly from SuperPro Designer or calculated in MS Excel based on information from SuperPro Designer.
